# Greetings! 👋 I'm Rayane Benamre, a dedicated **full-stack web developer**. 

🚀 Specializing in technologies like the MERN stack, NextJS, and SvelteKit, I focus on crafting efficient solutions. For styling, I prefer using TailwindCSS, and I employ Drizzle or Prisma for robust database queries.

🤖 Beyond web development, I also engage in Discord bot development and occasional mobile app projects.

🌱 Currently, I am in the process of mastering the Rust programming language.

📧 Feel free to reach out on Discord (see below!) or via email at `benamrerayane@proton.me`.
