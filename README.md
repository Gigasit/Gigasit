Hey! 👋 I'm Rayane Benamre, I'm a __full-stack web developer__. 😁

I specialize in various JavaScript frameworks and technologies including the MERN stack, NextJS, SvelteKit and many more libraries. I prefer TailwindCSS to style my components and the Prisma ORM to handle my database queries.
I also do Discord bot development and mobile app development from time to time.

I'm currently learning the Rust programming language. Pretty solid stuff.

You can contact me on Discord or through my email address at `benamrerayane@proton.me`.
